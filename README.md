# Managing File and Directory Permissions in Linux
This lab serves as an exploration of permissions on directories and files within Linux. We will check permissions to ensure that each is properly configured for their respective user, group, or other owners. The point here is to get a taste of the Principle of Least Privilege, which states that only the minimum amount of access for files and directories should be granted for the completion of necessary tasks related to the use of the data. 

## Context:

For a list of commands used in this lab, please see the end of the lab. For more information on these commands and their options, please refer to the 'man' page for each of them inside your linux bash shell. 

## Scenario:
You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

1. We begin by establishing who we are using the `whoami` command, which returns that we are `researcher2`. 
2. Next we need to know where we are, so we use the `pwd` command, which returns our working directory as `/home/researcher2`. 
3. We will be working in the projects directory, which we locate using the `ls -a` command to confirm its presence from our current working directory. 
4. We then use the `cd projects` command to drop into that location. 
5. Our instructions are to enumerate all of the files and directories within the projects directory and investigate permissions on several files. Here we see the returned information from the system using the `ls -la` command in order to include any hidden files in our current working directory. Below is the result, where we can see all permissions.

## Describe the permissions string

In the above image note that there is a series of 10 character strings that begin each line. These are permission strings, and they tell us what permissions are enabled on the given file or directory, as well as who has been given these levels of access. 

In this section, we’ll first discuss the possible characters and what each means. Next we'll discuss the types of owners of files in linux, and then we will tie that into the permissions string so we can use it as a tool to understand what the permissions are on file and directories. 

As you may note on observation, each string consists of a series of letters or hyphens. The characters used are as follows:

* A `d` at the beginning of a string represents the permissions for a directory
* A `-` (hyphen) at the beginning of a string represents the permissions for a file. If located within the string, the hyphen means that the permission has been revoked. 
* An `r` means that `read` permissions are granted. 
* A `w` means that `write` permissions are granted.
* An `x` means that `execute` permissions are granted. 

Next let’s observe that there are three types of owners in Linux:

* User - the owner or creator of the file. 
* Group - every user is part of some type of group. 
* Other - this is considered to be all other users on the system. 

From here we tie all of this information to the string itself. A useful way of conceptualizing these strings is to think of them as 1 + 3 + 3 + 3. In this case, the first character represents whether we are talking about a directory or file (`d` or `-` respectively), and the rest are “triplets” which pertain to one of three types of owners, that is users, groups, and others. In other words, characters 2-4 denote user permissions, 5-7 denote group permissions, and 8-10 denote other permissions.

If all permissions were enabled for everyone, that would end up looking like: `-rwxrwxrwx`

In the example `-rwxrwxrwx`, the hyphen in position 1 tells us we’re working with the permissions of a file. The first “triplet” of characters represent user permissions, the second triplet represents group permissions, and the last triplet represents other permissions. Now let’s take a look at our results again: 

<a href="https://imgur.com/rdtmKvG"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rdtmKvG.jpg" title="LC1.2" /></a>

If we take a look at the drafts directory, we see the permissions: `drwx--x---`
Read from left to right, we confirm we’re working with a directory (`d`). We can see that users have read, write, and execute privileges, groups only have execute privileges, and others have no privileges.

## Changing File Permissions

Now that we understand what we’re looking at, we’re going to change the permissions on one of these files. In order to do this, we’re going to use the `chmod` command, which will require that we first enter which permissions we want to edit, and specify the file or directory in which to implement those changes. Let’s learn how to do that first. 

When using `chmod`, we tie which type of owner with a `+` or `-` to whether we are adding or removing the permissions from them. We then insert the file or directory we are making the changes to. 

Consider the following: `chmod g+w,o-r access.txt`

Using `chmod` we must take into consideration that `u` = user, `g` = group, and `o` = others. As you’d expect, it follows that `r` =  read, `w` = write, and `x` = execute. Knowing this, we can deduce that this command is telling `chmod` to give group the write permission, and to remove others from the read permission on this file. Said in a more literally, it might read this way: “chmod group add write, others remove read access.txt file.” While this isn’t correct, it gives you an idea of the instruction you’re giving the computer. Please note that for each permission you edit, you must insert a comma between each set of changes, and you ***cannot*** put a space after the commas. Now that we understand `chmod`, let’s look at our files again. 

Let’s say that our organization does not allow others to have write access to *any* files. If we look closely, we can see that project_k.txt is currently configured incorrectly. To fix this, we’ll use the `chmod` command to alter the permissions for others on this file. 

<a href="https://imgur.com/ag1Sr7a"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ag1Sr7a.jpg" title="LC2.1" /></a>

Highlighted we can see that this file does allow others to write to the file. Next, we run our chmod command and tell it to remove the write permission from others: 

`chmod o-w project_k.txt` yields the following result:

<a href="https://imgur.com/p2E6i7h"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p2E6i7h.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Seen above, we have removed the write permission from others on project_k.txt now, and that is reflected by running our ls -la command to check the current permissions in the directory.

## Change File Permissions on a Hidden File

You may have noticed that by using the `ls -la` command to view the files in this directory, we have been listing a file that begins with a `.`. The `-la` argument tells the system to show us all of the files, including hidden ones. Hidden files and directories begin with `.` in the file system. Now let’s say that .project_x.txt is an archived file, which is why it’s been hidden from the normal list view. Our company policy is that no one is to have write permissions for archived files, and only users and groups may have read permissions. Given this, we can see that this hidden file is misconfigured, as it currently allows for user and group to write to it, however groups are not able to read it.

<a href="https://imgur.com/UJGLrwQ"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UJGLrwQ.jpg" title="LC3.1" /></a>

Let's change that by running `chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt` and we should see the following:

<a href="https://imgur.com/TKtoIBe"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TKtoIBe.jpg" title="LC3.2" /></a>

As you can see, we have now correctly configured .project_x.txt to be readable only by users and groups.

## Change Directory Permissions

In Linux, it's actually the `x` (execute) permission that allows a given owner the ability to see or access a directory. Let's say that we discover that our `drafts` directory has incorrect permissions enabled. Company policy states that only our user account (`researcher2`) has permission to access this directory. Our permissions tell us that currently, groups are also able to access this directory:

<a href="https://imgur.com/2PAKxHe"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2PAKxHe.jpg" title="LC4.1" /></a>

In order to correct this, we have to do two things. First, we have to make sure that we are currently in the parent directory to `drafts`, in this case the `projects` directory. 

From there we can run `chmod g-x drafts` to remove group access to the drafts directory:

<a href="https://imgur.com/erNn46N"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/erNn46N.jpg" title="LC4.2" /></a>

And we can now confirm that `researcher2` is the only user allowed to handle operations within the drafts directory, in compliance with company policy.

##Summary

In completing this lab we have learned how to identify ourselves on a linux command line, navigate to a target directory and confirm our location, and list all of the files and directories we want to see, including hidden files. We've configured the permissions on these files and directories in accordance with company policy and reduced our attack surface in doing so. Only those owners who require access to these files now have access, and unecessary permissions have been revoked where needed. In essense, we've strengthened one of the essential parts of the CIA Triad in our organization, namely Confidentiality. This is why regular audits are important; we must confirm that we aren't leaving holes in our attack surface to both internal and external threats. Least privilege requires that we only give permissions where absolutely necessary for employees to do their jobs, and of course to keep all unauthorized connections from outside the organzation from accessing our data.
