# Managing-Permissions-in-Linux
This lab serves as an exploration of permissions on directories and files within Linux. We will check permissions to ensure that each is properly configured for their respective user, group, or other owners. The point here is to get a taste of the Principle of Least Privilege, which states that only the minimum amount of access for files and directories should be granted for the completion of necessary tasks related to the use of the data. 

## Context:

For a list of commands used in this lab, please see the end of the lab. For more information on these commands and their options, please refer to the 'man' page for each of them inside your linux bash shell. 

## Scenario:
You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
